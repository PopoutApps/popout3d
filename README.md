Popout3D creates 3D images from photographs taken with an ordinary camera.
Take two photos of a subject and the software will create a 3D image from them. Vertical and rotational alignment of the left and right images is essential for a convincing 3D effect, but difficult to achieve with an ordinary camera. This software corrects it. 3D image formats that can be created are anaglyph (red/cyan), side-by-side and crossover. 
Several photos can be processed at once, the resulting images can be reviewed and poor ones deleted.
